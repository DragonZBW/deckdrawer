# Installation
Builds are located in the builds folder. Download the .zip file for your OS or clone the repo to get all builds.
### For Windows:
Simply extract the .zip file and run the enclosed .exe file.
### For Mac:
Extract the .zip file and run the application. If you get a message stating that the application can't be opened because it can't be checked for malicious software or because it comes from an unidentified developer, right click the file, hold the Option key, and click open. You should now be given the option to open the app anyway. If you get a different message stating that the application can't be opened without any further details, or if the message says the application is damaged, open Terminal and run this command: ``chmod +x (file path)``, then open the app.

# Usage
The instructions for the tool are listed in the application itself.
